This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my work as a **Senior Product Designer**.

## 🎨 About The Project

As a Product Designer, I wanted a portfolio that reflects my attention to detail and ability to build digital ecosystems. 

Instead of using standard website builders (like Tilda or Webflow), I decided to build a custom solution to have full control over the interactions, performance, and visual fidelity.

### Key Features:
*   **Custom Design System:** Minimalist layout focusing on visual hierarchy.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Custom cursor implementation with physics-based movement (lag effect).
*   **Sticky Scroll Animation:** Immersive hero section behavior.
*   **Responsive Layout:** Fully adaptive grid for Mobile and Desktop.
*   **Pure Performance:** Built without heavy frameworks for maximum speed.

## 🤖 Design & Development Process

This project is an experiment in **AI-Assisted Development**.

*   **Design:** The UX/UI, visual concept, and logic were designed by me (Figma).
*   **Code:** The implementation was executed through an iterative collaboration with **Claude AI**.

I used this project to bridge the gap between design and frontend engineering, prompting the AI to write clean, semantic HTML/CSS/JS while I acted as the Art Director and Quality Assurance lead for the code. This allowed me to bring complex interactions (like the magnetic cursor) to life quickly while maintaining high code standards.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Styling:** Flexbox, CSS Grid, Custom Variables, CSS Animations.
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages / Custom Domain.
